- Backend or API testing  
- Performance, security, and stress testing

## 6. Notable Observation
When the same product is added multiple times, the cart correctly displays the increased quantity.  
However, clicking **‚ÄúRemove‚Äù** removes the entire product instead of reducing the quantity by one.  
This behavior is consistent and might be part of the website‚Äôs intended design.
